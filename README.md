# Realtime Trading Outlier Detection Framework

- A real-time outlier detection framework for critical trading data using machine learning algorithms such as Isolation Forest
- Used Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Elasticsearch pipelined to a Grafana cloud dashboard as a scalable and real-time data visualization solution

## Production Link

Grafana dashboard can be found here: [<a href="rdao2003.grafana.net">Link</a>]

**Note:** EC2 instance that hosts the Spark, Kafka, and Elasticsearch pipeline may be turned off due to my AWS account having insufficient funds. Grafana dashboard will show no data in this event.
